You have several options, but they all boil down to _abstraction_:

* Integrate several building blocks into a single (_larger_) block. 
Either describe the contained elements in an additional lower-level diagram,
or explain them in writing.

* In case there are several relationships/dependencies (_lines_) between two elements, collapse those into a single _line_.
