There a a few options to simplify the setup of the arc42 structure within your Confluence&reg;:

* The [Networked-Assets ATC macro](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.networkedassets.plugins.space-blueprint/server/overview) to insert the arc42 template into any Confluence&reg; space.
* The [smartics Blueprints for arc42](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/de.smartics.atlassian.confluence.smartics-projectdoc-confluence-arc42/server/overview)
* You can get a pre-build Confluence&reg; space generated out of the  current version of the arc42-template. It's available under the [arc42 downloads](https://arc42.org/download) 

See [question F-9 (Diagrams in Confluence&reg;)](/questions/F-9) for an overview of diagramming tools available for Confluence&reg;.
