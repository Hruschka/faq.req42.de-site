In case you are referencing existing requirements in the architecture documentation, e.g.
to justify a design decision, you need to make sure that these requirements can be identified uniquely, by a short key or something similar.

* Sometimes you can take those IDs from the requirements documentation.
* If your requirements are managed by a tool (e.g. an issue tracker), you can use those ID's - with some tools you even have stable URLs.
