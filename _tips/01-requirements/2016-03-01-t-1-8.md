In this context you could also use a numbered lists as simple and pragmatic
way to describe activities, procedures or processes. The activity  
diagram from [tip-1-6](/tips/1-6) could then be documented as follows:

1. Authentication
2. Select a product
3. Check customer type
    1. Private customer, add the VAT (value-added tax)
    2. Business customer, ask for the VAT-ID
4. Create Invoice

In case you have to describe concurrent processes, activity diagrams
[see tip 1-6](/tips/1-6) are the better choice
