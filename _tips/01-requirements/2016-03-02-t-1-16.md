Although you must meet all quality goals that are required by the stakeholders, you should keep this section of the documentation
short. Here, in section 1.2, you describe only a handful (top 3-5) of these requirements.

Use brief explanations with scenarios (see [tip IV-12](/tips/1-12)),
not only keywords.

All the other qualities goals and requirements can either be found
in the requirements specification or in the quality tree in arc42 section 10.
