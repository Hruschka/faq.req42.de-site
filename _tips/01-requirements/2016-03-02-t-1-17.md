Sometimes you take decisions based on concrete and specific quality requirements.
In such cases, it helps to document these quality goals and the resulting decisions
in a consolidated table. We propose that you put such a table into the
[arc42 section 4 (solution strategy)](/section-4) (see especially [tip 4-2 (solution strategy as table)](/tips/4-2)).


Here, in arc42-section 1.2 (quality goals), you then only add a reference.
