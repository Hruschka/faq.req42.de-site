You should explicitly represent the expectations of these stakeholders (see above)
with respect to the architecture and its documentation in the form of a table.


#### Minimal stakeholder table
You can find a minimal version in the table below, which
only outlines the expectations or required artifacts.


| Role          | Expectation                                    |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Administrator | Deployment-overview, installation and operations details, firewalls  |
| QA department |Description of the interfaces for load testing, possible measuring points for performance testing, technical concept for security and reliability|

**Table: Stakeholder table with roles and expectation**

#### Detailed stakeholder table

including the relevance for approval and contact information. Please pay attention to
