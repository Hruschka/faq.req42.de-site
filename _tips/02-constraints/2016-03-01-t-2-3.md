Organizational constraints like time and budget are for good reason unpopular with
development teams, because they limit the freedom of design or implementation decisions
very strongly. Therefore disclose these types of constraints.

Sometimes such constraints relate to development processes, third party contracting or
legal concerns. Discuss them with your management.
