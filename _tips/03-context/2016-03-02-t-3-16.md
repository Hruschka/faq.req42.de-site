As you can see in [tip 3-10 (business- and technical context)](/tips/3-10),
you can explicitly label protocols (SSH, HTTPS, VPN) or channels
(CAN bus) within the context.

Alas: To save effort, you might amend the business context with
information about technical protocols (like ftp, https or similar.)
See [tip 3-17 (amend business context with technical information)](/tips/3-17).
