Describe the solution approaches as a table containing the following columns:

* quality goal: What's the top-level goal?
* scenario: What is a or the detailed scenario for this quality goal?
* solution approach: How does the system approach this scenario? What tactics, approaches or decisions have been taken in this direction?
* link to details: Where are the details of this solution described? This link will either point to a concrete building block, (implementing the approach) or a section of the crosscutting concepts.

| **Quality goal** | **Scenario** | **Solution approach** | **Link to Details** |
|----------|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|
| _&lt;Q-goal 1>_ | _&lt;Text>_ | _&lt;Text>_ |_&lt;Link>_ |
| _&lt;Q-goal 2>_ | _&lt;Text>_ | _&lt;Text>_ |_&lt;Link>_ |
