Avoid redundancy, don't repeat information from views or concepts.

In the tabular version of the solution strategy (shown in [tip 4-2 (solution strategy as table)](/tips/4-2) and [tip 4-3 (solution in context with quality requirements)](/tips/4-3)) you should document only briefly -
and refer (link) to detailed explanations in arc42 sections 5 (building blocks),
6 (runtime view) or 8 (crosscutting concepts).

Links to external documents or references are ok, as long as your stakeholders
can easily find and access such refered-documents.
