Even when you document **very frugal**, have limited time or resources
for documentation available... you should follow one of the most essential rules
of architecture documentation:

#### Always describe level-1 of the building block view


**Level-1:**

* makes the top-level structure of building blocks explicit!

* very often remains quite stable over time - as the top-level system
decomposition often has little or no volatility.

* therefore causes only little maintenance or change effort...

* needs to be consistent (with respect to external interfaces)
to the system scope and context (see [tip 5-4 (consistency of level-1 to external interfaces)](/tips/5-4))
