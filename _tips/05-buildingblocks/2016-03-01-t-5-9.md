In case you want to influence the internal structure of a whitebox,
but don't want to specify all details, you may apply techniques
from the runtime view:

Describe the required (runtime) behavior of the whitebox, for example
with:

* pseudo-code
* activity diagrams or flowcharts
* state diagrams or state-machines

Such information provides architects or developers with _some_ information
_how_ this whitebox should be constructed or build, but does not specify
all contained details.
