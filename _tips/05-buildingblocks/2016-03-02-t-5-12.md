In case you document or specify detailed building blocks
on lower levels of the hierarchy, those (detailed) building blocks
should always have a root on higher levels.

Every detailed building block shall have a (non-interrupted)
hierarchy of parents, all the way up to level-1.

**Don't skip levels.**
