In case your mapping of source code to building-blocks is non-trivial,
your arc42 documentation should explicitly state where to find the sources.

* In case you stick to [Tip 5-15 (building-blocks aligned with directory structure)](/tips/5-15), you only need to document or specify the root directory
of your source code repository. Further details will result from this root directory.
* In case your source code is managed in different repositories (e.g. different git or subversion repositories), you should add a link to these repositories
on the level-1 building blocks.
* In case your source code is distributed over several directories, you might
document the location of your 2-3 most important source artifacts per building block.

>NEVER fall into the trap of listing **all** code artifacts for any whitebox,
as that information is so volatile...
