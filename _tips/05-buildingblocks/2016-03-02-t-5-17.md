## Cohesion is king!

Cohesion is one of the most fundamental and classical software engineering
design principles. It refers to the degree to which the elements of
any architecture building block (component, module, subsystem, package etc.)
_belong_ together".


## Cohesion is difficult

If it was simple, we wouldn't write about it... What _belongs_ together
will depend on your viewpoint - and might be different for various stakeholders.

There should be consistent, homogeneous rules or principles for cohesion
within your system.

## Group elements that _belong_ together

Some criteria for elements belonging together:

* similar business functions or processes
* operating on similar data
* used by similar users
* implemented in similar technologies or
* following similar implementation rules/concepts
* deployed in a similar ways or on similar hardware
* distributed or packaged in similar ways
* implemented or maintained by the same people
* &lt;you-name-it>
