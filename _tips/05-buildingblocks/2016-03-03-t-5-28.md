This tip might sound strange in context with building blocks -
but sometimes it's easy or helpful to explain the fundamental
or crosscutting concepts (other terms are _principles_,
  _styles_, _stereotypes_ or _patterns_) instead of
  all the building blocks.

For example, if you build a microservice-based system or
constructed system as a pipe-and-filter architecture, the explanation
of the fundamental principles might be more useful than the
elaborate discussion of single building blocks.

## But - Level-1 is still your friend

Please keep in mind [tip 5-3 (level-1 is your friend)](/tips/5-3)
