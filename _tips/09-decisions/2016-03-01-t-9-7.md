During software development a multitude of decisions have to be taken, that
you don't want to keep in the (formal or official) architecture documentation -
but which _could_ somehow be relevant for the development team.

You could document and publish those decisions as a blog (RSS-feed),
so that the development team can easily search and retrieve them.
