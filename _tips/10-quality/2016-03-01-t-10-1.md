Move details, especially of quality requirement, to _this_ section 10.

Here you have the quality tree (section 10.1) as an (often graphical) overview,
and the quality scenarios (section 10.2) as a collection of many (or all) additional
quality requirements.

We participated in the development of several systems having more
than 100 different quality scenarios. In such cases, arc42 section 10.2 is the
right place to document these (if they are not contained within written and
  easily accessible requirements documentation).
