Mind-maps provide the ability to hierarchically structure (like a tree), but
are sometimes more reader-friendly. Mind-mapping tools often allow references
between different parts of the map.

You find an example below. Please note the little "+" sign at some entries, denoting
additional information that's currently hidden.

We like to include references to specific scenarios in the tree,
in the example below the major quality goals, e.g. Performance, usability, correctness and others.
