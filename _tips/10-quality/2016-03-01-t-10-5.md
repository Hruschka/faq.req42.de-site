Many quality scenarios will be related to usage of the system (application scenarios, use-case scenarios).
Some authors call these _externally visible quality".

This is related to top-level goals like functionality, processing speed, correctness of calculations or processing,
robustness concerning faulty data input, data security or confidentiality.

Application scenarios describe how the system shall behave when used by humans or via arbitrary interfaces.

Examples:

* Execution of function/use-case XYZ at the graphical UI takes less than one second.
* Less than 2 seconds after successful login users get displayed a list of all bookings from the last week.
* Administrators can modify access rights of users via GUI with a maximum of five clicks.
